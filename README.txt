Balanced Brackets Algorithm
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This means that the algorithm processes each character of the string once.

Space Complexity:

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n). This means that in the worst case, the algorithm might need space proportional to the length of the input string to store unmatched opening brackets in a stack.
